You've provided a correct distinction between a web server and an application server. Let's delve a bit deeper into each concept:

##Web Server:**
A web server primarily serves static content to clients over the HTTP protocol. Static content refers to files that don't change unless the server administrator modifies them. This can include HTML files, images, videos, CSS files, JavaScript files, etc. Web servers excel at quickly responding to simple HTTP requests for these static resources.

Some popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS).

*Application Server:**
An application server, on the other hand, is designed to handle dynamic content and business logic. It's responsible for processing data and generating dynamic responses based on user input or other triggers. Application servers are often used in more complex web applications that require interaction with databases, user authentication, session management, and other dynamic functionalities.

Application servers typically provide services like connection pooling, transaction management, security, and integration with other backend systems. They can communicate with databases, external APIs, and other resources to fulfill the business logic requirements of an application.

It's important to note that in many modern architectures, the lines between web servers and application servers have blurred. Some web servers can also handle dynamic content through server-side scripting languages like PHP or even by proxying requests to an underlying application server.

In summary, while web servers focus on serving static content, application servers handle dynamic content and complex business logic. In many cases, both types of servers work together to deliver a complete web application experience.
